How to Run / Test
-----------------
There are two ways for you to demo the Neighborhood Maps application:    

1. Simply visit the [live version](http://www.vincentmaling.com/np/maptest.html "Neighborhood Maps") hosted on my web server.  
2. Download the Git ZIP, extract, and run maps.html on your favorite browser. 

The application has been fully tested on Chrome, Firefox, IE 11, and Android Default Browser. It runs on desktops, tablets and mobile devices like smartphones.
NOTE: If you intend to run the application on IE, I'd recommend option 1 above to avoid having to host the PHP file from your local machine. See Additional Notes.
